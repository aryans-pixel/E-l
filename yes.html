      <h1>Hehehehe, I knew it! Love you a lot and Im Sorry 😘</h1>
      <h1>Bubu, I take full ownership of what I did the words came from me, and I crossed a line that hurt you deeply. I understand that now, and I’m truly sorry for the pain I caused someone I love so much. I want to be more mindful, more careful, and more respectful with my words, always not just today. If there is ever a small space for me to show that through my actions, I would cherish that chance; if not, I still respect you and your feelings.</h1>
